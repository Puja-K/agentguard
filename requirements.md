# AgentGuard V0 Requirements

## 1. Product Objective

AgentGuard is a local-first developer tool that identifies potentially important AI-agent behaviors that are not adequately represented in the agent's existing eval or regression-test suite.

The primary V0 question is:

> What important behaviors in this agent appear insufficiently tested?

V0 exists to validate whether AgentGuard can find gaps that engineers consider useful enough to act on.

The core product hypothesis is:

> If AgentGuard identifies a credible missing eval, an engineer will add or modify a test because of that finding.

---

## 2. Target User

The primary V0 user is an AI or agent engineer responsible for an agent that already has an eval or regression-test suite.

The user may have:

- prompts
- tool definitions
- workflow definitions
- pytest tests
- JSONL eval datasets

The user should not need to create a new capability taxonomy, policy system, requirements database, or governance process before using AgentGuard.

---

## 3. Primary User Workflow

A user should eventually be able to run:

```bash
agentguard scan <repository-path>
```

AgentGuard should:

1. inspect the repository
2. discover supported agent artifacts
3. extract candidate agent behaviors
4. discover existing eval scenarios
5. map behaviors to existing evals
6. classify behaviors as:
   - covered
   - partially covered
   - potentially uncovered
7. explain why each finding was produced
8. suggest a missing eval scenario where appropriate
9. assign stable IDs to behaviors and findings
10. preserve user feedback across future scans
11. detect when a new or modified eval appears to resolve a previous finding

---

## 4. Supported V0 Inputs

V0 should support:

- Python source code
- prompt strings discoverable in supported Python source
- supported standalone prompt files
- agent tool definitions
- agent/workflow definitions
- LangGraph workflows where practical
- pytest-based tests/evals
- supported JSONL eval datasets
- optional AgentGuard configuration

V0 does not require:

- production traces
- cloud integrations
- Jira
- Confluence
- Slack
- governance systems
- policy repositories
- hosted storage

---

## 5. Initial Supported Prompt Formats

V0 should initially support prompt discovery from:

- Python string literals assigned to clearly identifiable prompt variables
- Python strings passed directly into supported agent/model constructors where statically discoverable
- `.txt` prompt files
- `.md` prompt files

Prompt extraction should remain static.

AgentGuard must not execute target repository code in order to discover prompts.

Unsupported or ambiguous prompt formats should be reported as unsupported rather than guessed.

Additional prompt formats may be added later.

---

## 6. Initial Supported JSONL Eval Format

V0 should support a minimal documented JSONL format.

Each line should be a valid JSON object.

AgentGuard should initially recognize these fields when present:

```json
{
  "input": "user input or scenario",
  "expected": "expected response or behavior",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "optional eval name",
    "tools": ["optional", "tool", "names"],
    "tags": ["optional", "tags"]
  }
}
```

Required:

- `input`

Optional:

- `expected`
- `metadata`
- `metadata.name`
- `metadata.tools`
- `metadata.tags`

If `expected` is absent, AgentGuard may still discover the scenario but must not assume the expected outcome has been verified.

Unknown fields should be preserved where practical but ignored for V0 matching unless explicitly supported.

Malformed JSONL records should produce a scan warning and should not crash the entire scan.

---

## 7. Behavior Representation

Each extracted behavior should contain at minimum:

- behavior ID
- human-readable description
- behavior type
- source file
- source symbol where available
- source evidence
- extractor that produced it

Potential behavior types may include:

- tool invocation
- tool failure
- conditional behavior
- workflow branch
- fallback behavior
- escalation
- prohibited action
- required action

Examples:

- a tool can be invoked
- a tool can fail with a specific exception
- a workflow can follow a conditional branch
- a prompt requires escalation above a threshold
- an agent must avoid taking an action if authentication fails

---

## 8. Eval Representation

Each discovered eval should contain at minimum:

- eval ID
- test/eval name
- source file
- source symbol where available
- scenario description where inferable
- assertions or expected outcomes where inferable
- tools or behaviors referenced where inferable

AgentGuard should distinguish between:

- an eval that merely mentions or invokes a behavior
- an eval that actually verifies the expected outcome

---

## 9. Coverage States

V0 supports three coverage states.

### Covered

A behavior may be marked `covered` only when AgentGuard has evidence that at least one existing eval:

1. materially exercises the behavior or relevant condition, and
2. verifies the expected outcome or invariant.

Examples of acceptable evidence may include:

- a pytest test invokes the relevant tool/branch and asserts the expected result
- a test explicitly verifies the expected exception/fallback/escalation
- a JSONL eval contains the relevant scenario and an expected outcome that corresponds to the behavior

Merely:

- mentioning the same tool
- referencing the same function
- exercising a neighboring branch
- using similar keywords

is not sufficient to mark a behavior as covered.

When evidence is ambiguous, prefer `partially_covered` or `potentially_uncovered`.

### Partially Covered

A behavior is `partially_covered` when an eval exercises the relevant functionality but does not fully verify an important condition, branch, failure mode, or expected outcome.

Example:

- the refund tool is tested successfully
- timeout behavior for the same tool is not tested

### Potentially Uncovered

A behavior is `potentially_uncovered` when AgentGuard finds no eval that appears to materially exercise and verify the behavior.

AgentGuard must avoid implying certainty.

Use language such as:

> Potentially uncovered

rather than:

> Definitely untested

unless a deterministic rule genuinely establishes that conclusion.

---

## 10. No Numeric Behavioral Coverage Percentage in V0

V0 must not present a numeric behavioral coverage percentage such as:

> 82% covered

The denominator for agent behavioral coverage is not yet trustworthy enough to support that claim.

V0 should instead present:

- identified behaviors
- matched evals
- partially covered behaviors
- potentially uncovered behaviors
- confidence and evidence

---

## 11. Findings

Each finding should contain:

- stable finding ID
- associated behavior ID
- coverage status
- confidence
- supporting evidence
- matched eval IDs
- explanation
- suggested missing scenario, if applicable

Every actionable finding should answer:

- what behavior was detected
- where it came from
- what existing evals were considered
- why AgentGuard believes coverage may be incomplete
- what additional scenario may close the gap

---

## 12. Static Analysis and Execution Safety

AgentGuard must not import or execute code from the target repository during scanning.

Scanning must be based on static analysis.

AgentGuard must not:

- import target repository modules
- execute target repository tests
- invoke target repository functions
- run arbitrary scripts from the target repository
- make network calls on behalf of scanned code
- access target application credentials by executing repository code

This requirement exists to avoid:

- side effects
- dependency conflicts
- unintended API calls
- credential exposure
- malicious code execution
- non-reproducible scanning behavior

AgentGuard may inspect source files, syntax trees, configuration files, and supported static metadata.

If a behavior cannot be determined without executing the target repository, V0 should report that limitation rather than execute the code.

---

## 13. Feedback Loop

Feedback and resolution tracking are mandatory V0 features.

Every actionable finding should support these dispositions:

- `add_eval`
- `valid_later`
- `already_covered`
- `not_relevant`
- `suppressed`

Feedback must persist locally across scans.

A future scan should attempt to determine whether a new or modified eval appears to resolve a previously open finding.

---

## 14. Feedback Meaning

### add_eval

The user indicates that the finding is valid and intends to add or modify an eval.

### valid_later

The user agrees the gap is valid but does not intend to address it immediately.

### already_covered

The user believes the behavior is already adequately tested and AgentGuard failed to detect the coverage correctly.

This should be treated as an important false-positive/matching-quality signal.

### not_relevant

The user believes the detected behavior does not require coverage or is not relevant to their testing strategy.

### suppressed

The user does not want AgentGuard to continue surfacing this finding.

Suppression does not necessarily mean the finding was incorrect.

---

## 15. Observed Resolution vs Confirmed Product Impact

AgentGuard must distinguish between two different concepts.

### Observed Test Resolution

AgentGuard detects that a new or modified eval now appears to adequately cover a previously open finding.

Example:

```text
Finding AG-123:
payment lookup timeout appears untested

Later scan:
tests/test_payment.py::test_payment_timeout now matches the behavior
```

This may be recorded as:

> Observed resolution

AgentGuard must not assume that the engineer created the test because of AgentGuard.

### User-Confirmed Impact

The user explicitly confirms that an AgentGuard finding caused them to add or modify an eval.

Examples:

- selecting `add_eval`
- accepting a suggested eval
- confirming after resolution that the finding caused the test change

This may be recorded as:

> Confirmed product impact

Observed resolution and confirmed impact must remain separate metrics.

---

## 16. Feedback Metric Definitions

V0 should support calculating the following metrics.

### Valid Gap Rate

Measures whether engineers agree that surfaced gaps are genuine.

Eligible reviewed findings:

- `add_eval`
- `valid_later`
- `already_covered`
- `not_relevant`

Suggested definition:

```text
add_eval + valid_later
----------------------
eligible reviewed findings
```

`suppressed` should not automatically be counted as valid or invalid unless the user also supplies a reason.

### Actionable Gap Rate

Measures whether findings cause engineers to act.

Primary confirmed version:

```text
findings explicitly confirmed as causing an eval change
--------------------------------------------------------
eligible high-confidence findings reviewed
```

A separate observed metric may track:

```text
findings followed by detected eval resolution
---------------------------------------------
eligible findings
```

These two metrics must not be conflated.

### False Positive Rate

Suggested definition:

```text
already_covered + clearly incorrect findings
---------------------------------------------
eligible reviewed findings
```

`not_relevant` should not automatically count as a false positive because the detected behavior may be real even if the user does not consider it worth testing.

### Resolved-by-Test Rate

Measures whether previously open findings later become covered.

```text
open findings later resolved by new/modified eval
-------------------------------------------------
eligible previously open findings
```

The product should preserve enough history to calculate these metrics consistently.

---

## 17. Stable Behavior IDs

Behavior IDs should remain stable across:

- whitespace changes
- formatting changes
- line-number movement
- non-semantic changes around the behavior

Line numbers must not be the primary basis for identity.

Behavior identity should instead use stable semantic or structural attributes where possible, such as:

- normalized behavior type
- symbol identity
- tool/workflow identity
- normalized condition
- normalized expected action/outcome

---

## 18. Rename and Move Limitations

V0 should make a best-effort attempt to preserve stable IDs when code is moved or renamed.

However, V0 does not guarantee identity preservation across:

- file renames
- symbol renames
- function moves between modules
- major workflow restructuring
- substantial prompt rewrites

If AgentGuard cannot confidently determine that a moved or renamed behavior is the same logical behavior, it may:

- create a new behavior ID
- mark the previous finding as no longer observed
- avoid claiming that the previous issue has been resolved

This limitation should be documented.

A later version may support stronger rename/move tracking using repository history.

---

## 19. Stable Finding IDs

Finding IDs should derive from the underlying behavior and finding type rather than:

- line number
- scan timestamp
- arbitrary ordering

A finding should normally retain the same ID across repeated scans when the underlying behavior and coverage concern are materially unchanged.

A materially changed behavior may generate a new finding ID.

---

## 20. Incomplete Scan Handling

AgentGuard must distinguish between:

- a successful complete scan
- a successful but incomplete scan
- a failed scan

A scan may be incomplete because:

- files could not be parsed
- unsupported syntax was encountered
- an extractor failed
- an expected artifact format was unsupported
- part of the repository was inaccessible
- scan limits were reached

When a scan is incomplete:

1. AgentGuard must surface warnings describing what was not analyzed.
2. AgentGuard must not silently treat missing analysis as proof of missing eval coverage.
3. Findings dependent on unavailable evidence should be:
   - withheld, or
   - marked inconclusive/low-confidence.
4. Previously known findings must not automatically be marked resolved merely because the behavior was not observed in an incomplete scan.
5. Historical state should be preserved.
6. Metrics should exclude findings whose status cannot be confidently determined because of scan incompleteness.

The product should prefer:

> Unable to determine coverage because part of the repository could not be analyzed.

over:

> Potentially uncovered

when the required evidence was unavailable.

---

## 21. Explainability Requirements

For every partially covered or potentially uncovered behavior, AgentGuard should show:

- what behavior was detected
- the source artifact
- the relevant file and symbol
- relevant source evidence
- what existing evals were considered
- why those evals were insufficient
- the confidence level
- what additional eval scenario may be useful

AgentGuard should favor evidence over opaque scores.

---

## 22. Confidence

V0 may use qualitative confidence levels:

- high
- medium
- low

Confidence should represent confidence in the finding or match, not a probability that the agent is safe or correct.

Examples:

### High confidence

A deterministic tool failure exists and no discovered eval references or verifies that failure mode.

### Medium confidence

A semantic match suggests neighboring behavior is tested but the exact condition may not be.

### Low confidence

The behavior was inferred from ambiguous natural-language prompt text.

Low-confidence findings should not dominate the default output.

---

## 23. Local Persistence

V0 should store local AgentGuard state under:

```text
.agentguard/
```

Persistence may initially use:

- JSON, or
- SQLite

The persistence layer should support at minimum:

- finding history
- feedback dispositions
- first-seen timestamp
- last-seen timestamp
- open/resolved state
- observed resolution
- user-confirmed impact where available

No hosted backend is required.

---

## 24. CLI Requirements

At minimum, V0 should eventually support:

```bash
agentguard scan <path>
agentguard findings
agentguard feedback <finding-id> <disposition>
```

The exact syntax may evolve during implementation.

Commands should return clear errors for:

- nonexistent paths
- unsupported repositories
- malformed configuration
- malformed JSONL
- incomplete scans

---

## 25. Quality Requirements

The scanner should prioritize precision over recall.

It is better to surface:

> 5 findings that engineers agree are useful

than:

> 50 speculative findings

Every major capability must have automated tests.

Important test cases include:

1. behavior with matching eval
2. behavior with no matching eval
3. partially covered behavior
4. multiple evals matching one behavior
5. one eval covering multiple behaviors
6. suppressed finding
7. finding marked already covered
8. stable ID across whitespace changes
9. stable ID across line movement
10. new eval resolving a prior finding
11. incomplete scan does not falsely resolve findings
12. unsupported file does not crash the scan
13. repository code is never imported or executed during scan
14. JSONL scenario without expected output does not count as verified coverage
15. user-confirmed impact remains separate from observed resolution

---

## 26. V0 Validation Criteria

Before progressing to V1, we want evidence that:

- at least 20 real users or repositories have been evaluated
- at least 70% of reviewed high-confidence findings are considered valid
- at least 30% of eligible high-confidence findings cause an eval to be added or modified
- false-positive rate is below approximately 20–25%
- users perform repeat scans
- there are concrete examples of:

```text
finding
→ engineer agrees it is valid
→ eval added or modified
→ finding later resolved
```

The strongest validation signal is:

> An engineer added or changed an eval because AgentGuard found a gap they did not already know about.

GitHub stars, installs, and downloads are useful secondary metrics but are not sufficient V0 validation.

---

## 27. Out of Scope for V0

Do not build:

- cloud dashboard
- production trace ingestion
- production monitoring
- GitHub Actions integration
- GitHub PR comments
- release gating
- agent certification
- enterprise governance workflows
- policy-management platform
- Jira integration
- Confluence integration
- Slack integration
- SSO
- RBAC
- multi-tenant SaaS backend
- enterprise audit platform
- enterprise agent inventory
- VPC deployment
- numeric behavioral coverage score

Planned progression:

- GitHub Actions / CI integration: V1
- change-aware coverage: V1.5
- production-informed coverage: V2
- credible coverage intelligence: V2.5
- release assurance: V3
- requirements/policy traceability: V4
- enterprise agent assurance: V5

---

## 28. V0 Product Principles

### Precision over recall

Do not maximize the number of findings.

Maximize the number of findings engineers consider genuinely useful.

### Evidence over scoring

Every important conclusion should have inspectable evidence.

### Static and safe by default

Scanning must not execute untrusted repository code.

### Local first

The core V0 experience should work locally without a hosted backend.

### Developer workflow first

AgentGuard should feel like an engineering tool, not a compliance platform.

### Low setup

Users should receive useful results from artifacts already present in their repository.

### No false assurance

AgentGuard identifies potential missing eval coverage.

It does not certify that an agent is:

- safe
- correct
- compliant
- production-ready
- fully tested

### Product impact must be measurable

AgentGuard should distinguish between:

- finding something
- a user agreeing it is valid
- a test later appearing
- the user confirming AgentGuard caused the test change

Those are different signals and should remain separate.

## Metric and Impact Clarifications

### add_eval

`add_eval` represents user intent to add or modify an eval.

It does not by itself count as confirmed product impact.

### observed_resolution

`observed_resolution` is recorded when a later scan detects that a new or
modified eval now appears to cover the finding.

Observed resolution does not prove AgentGuard caused the change.

### confirmed_impact

`confirmed_impact` requires explicit user confirmation that the AgentGuard
finding caused or materially influenced the eval change.

### Finding Counting

Metrics count unique stable finding IDs, not repeated scan appearances.

### Review Eligibility

A finding is considered reviewed when the user selects:

- add_eval
- valid_later
- already_covered
- not_relevant

Suppression alone is not a reviewed outcome unless a reason is also recorded.

### Confidence Cohort

Metric eligibility uses the finding confidence at the time of first review.

### Reopened Findings

A reopened finding retains its original finding ID and is not counted as a new
finding. Reopen events should be tracked separately.

### Revised Feedback

The latest user disposition is the current state, but all prior feedback events
must remain in history.

### False Positive Signal

`already_covered` is the primary V0 false-positive signal.

`not_relevant` does not automatically count as a false positive.

## Metric Definitions

Metrics are calculated over unique stable `finding_id` values, not scan appearances.

A finding is considered `reviewed` when the latest explicit user disposition is one of:

- `add_eval`
- `valid_later`
- `already_covered`
- `not_relevant`

A `suppressed` finding is excluded from reviewed cohorts unless it also has an explicit review reason.

Findings whose assessment was unavailable because of an incomplete or failed scan are excluded from metric denominators until they become assessable.

Confidence eligibility is determined using the finding confidence at the time of first review.

Reopened findings retain the same finding ID and are not counted as new findings.

### Valid Gap Rate

Measures whether reviewed findings are considered genuine gaps by users.

Numerator:

- `add_eval`
- `valid_later`

Denominator:

- all eligible reviewed findings

Formula:

Valid Gap Rate =
(`add_eval` + `valid_later`) / eligible reviewed findings

### Intent-to-Act Rate

Measures whether users intend to change their eval suite because of a finding.

Numerator:

- findings with current disposition `add_eval`

Denominator:

- eligible reviewed findings

Formula:

Intent-to-Act Rate =
`add_eval` / eligible reviewed findings

`add_eval` represents intent only and must not be interpreted as confirmed product impact.

### Observed Resolution Rate

Measures whether previously open findings later appear to become covered by a new or modified eval.

Numerator:

- eligible findings with `observed_resolution = true`

Denominator:

- eligible previously open findings that have had at least one subsequent complete scan

Formula:

Observed Resolution Rate =
observed resolutions / eligible previously open findings with follow-up scans

Observed resolution does not establish that AgentGuard caused the eval change.

### Confirmed Impact Rate

Measures whether users explicitly confirm that AgentGuard caused or materially influenced an eval addition or modification.

Numerator:

- eligible findings with explicit `confirmed_impact = true`

Denominator:

- eligible reviewed high-confidence findings

Formula:

Confirmed Impact Rate =
confirmed-impact findings / eligible reviewed high-confidence findings

Confirmed impact must require an explicit user confirmation event.

### False Positive Rate

Measures findings where the user indicates that adequate coverage already existed and AgentGuard failed to identify it.

Numerator:

- findings whose current disposition is `already_covered`

Denominator:

- eligible reviewed findings

Formula:

False Positive Rate =
`already_covered` / eligible reviewed findings

`not_relevant` must not automatically count as a false positive.

### Resolved-by-Test Rate

Measures whether open findings later become covered by a new or modified eval.

Numerator:

- findings with observed test resolution

Denominator:

- eligible findings that were previously open and have had at least one subsequent complete scan

Formula:

Resolved-by-Test Rate =
findings resolved by test / eligible previously open findings with follow-up scans
